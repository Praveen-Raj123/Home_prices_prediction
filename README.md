# Goal
Using linear regression to predict house prices based on the area
Dependent variable = Price
Independent variable = Area

# Pros using Linear Regression
-  simple to implement and easier to interpret the output coefficients
-  susceptible to over-fitting but it can be avoided using some dimensionality reduction techniques, regularization (L1 and L2) techniques and cross-validation.
-  When you know the relationship between the independent and dependent variable have a linear relationship, this algorithm is the best to use because of itâ€™s less complexity compared to other algorithms.

# Cons using Linear Regression
- outliers can have huge effects on the regression and boundaries are linear in this technique.
- linear regression assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. That means it assumes that there is a straight-line relationship between them. It assumes independence between attributes.
